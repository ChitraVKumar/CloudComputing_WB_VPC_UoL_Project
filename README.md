# CloudComputing_WB_VPC_UoL_Project

Hosting an application over a Virtual private Cloud with server nodes running on at least two EC2 instances. 
Design and document the architecture of a private cloud, implement it, and then deploy on it a whiteboard application. The whiteboard application should run on at least
two separate machines/nodes within your private cloud, each applications instance serving a different group of users. You have to demonstrate that the distributed 
application running in your private cloud is consistent in a way that all the users will see the same application state across different instances. The application 
should scale to support a number of additional users and offer an improved quality of service as compared to the one if it was running on a single machine.
